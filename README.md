# Microphone-Operational-Amplifier
code base for EE2361 project implementing a Microphone Operational Amplifier on a PIC24 microcontroller 


Project Description / Core Concept:
Takes in analog audio input from the Electret microphone amplifier, filters it based on selector/s for varying bandwidths perform adc, process, and amplify the signal, and output to a speaker or other device in a defined digital output format. 
Proposed New Component:
Electret microphone amplifier 416-2000
Breakdown of Roles by Tasks
Dillon Gustafson: Analog to Digital conversion and amplification
Cooper Froemming: output formatting/standardization, volume control
Adan Wodzinski: input filtering/processing
